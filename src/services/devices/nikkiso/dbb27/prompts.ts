14. B CONDUCT - Bicarbonate conductivity (mS/cm, e.g., "3.0", "3.2", "2.8") - Look for "B.CONDUCT" or "B CONDUCT" labels
15. IP TOTAL - Infusion pump total volume (mL or L, e.g., "4300", "4.3", "5200", "6.8") - CRITICAL: Look for "IP TOTAL", "IP.TOTAL", "IP", "INFUSION", "INF TOTAL", "I.P.", or any label containing "IP" near volume values
16. Na CONDUCT - Sodium concentration (mEq/L or mmol/L, e.g., "140", "138")

**CRITICAL SEARCH AREAS FOR IP TOTAL - ENHANCED TARGETING:**

IP TOTAL is a CRITICAL parameter that tracks cumulative infusion volume. Use this COMPREHENSIVE search strategy:

**SEARCH METHOD 1 - Label-Based Search:**
- **Primary labels**: "IP TOTAL", "IP.TOTAL", "IP TOTAL VOL"
- **Secondary labels**: "INFUSION TOTAL", "INF TOTAL", "INFUSION VOL"
- **Abbreviated labels**: "IP", "I.P.", "IP VOL", "IP VOLUME"
- **Alternative labels**: "PUMP TOTAL", "INFUSION PUMP", "IV TOTAL"
- **Partial labels**: Any text containing "IP" near large volume numbers

**SEARCH METHOD 2 - Value Pattern Recognition:**
- **Large volume numbers**: Look for values >3000 (typically 4000-8000 range)
- **Format variations**: "4300", "5200", "6800" (mL) OR "4.3", "5.2", "6.8" (L)
- **Context clues**: Usually LARGER than UF volumes (cumulative vs. current)
- **Prominence**: Often displayed prominently as critical infusion tracking

**SEARCH METHOD 3 - Location-Based Search:**
- **Infusion section**: Check dedicated infusion/pump parameter area
- **Volume grouping**: Look near other volume measurements
- **Pump controls**: Check pump-related display sections
- **Status area**: May be in machine status or totals section

**SEARCH METHOD 4 - Visual Characteristics:**
- **Large numbers**: IP TOTAL values are typically large (>3000)
- **Decimal format**: May show as "4.3 L" instead of "4300 mL"
- **Cumulative nature**: Should be larger than current UF volumes
- **Update frequency**: May change slowly compared to other parameters

**ENHANCED SCAN STRATEGY FOR IP TOTAL:**
1. **SCAN ALL SECTIONS**: Check every display area systematically
2. **LOOK FOR "IP" TEXT**: Any occurrence of "IP" letters near numbers
3. **IDENTIFY LARGE VOLUMES**: Find numbers >3000 that aren't UF-related
4. **CHECK PUMP AREAS**: Focus on infusion pump control sections
5. **DECIMAL CONVERSION**: Convert L to mL if needed (4.3 L = 4300 mL)
6. **CONTEXT VALIDATION**: Ensure value makes sense as cumulative infusion

CRITICAL SEARCH AREAS FOR MISSING VALUES:

FOR DIALY PRESS:
- Look in pressure monitoring section
- May be labeled as "DIALY PRESS", "DIALYSATE PRESS", or "DP"
- Usually displayed with other pressure readings
- Typical range: 0-500 mmHg

FOR IP TOTAL:
- **PRIORITY SEARCH**: Look in ALL sections of the display for ANY label containing "IP"
- **Label variations**: "IP TOTAL", "IP.TOTAL", "IP", "INFUSION", "INF TOTAL", "I.P.", "IP VOL", "IP VOLUME"
- **Location hints**: May be in volume section, pump section, or separate infusion area
- **Value format**: Large numbers like "4300", "5200", "6800" (mL) or decimal like "4.3", "5.2", "6.8" (L)
- **Visual cues**: Often displayed prominently as it tracks total infused volume
- **Context clues**: Look for values that are LARGER than UF volumes (cumulative infusion)
- **Alternative search**: If "IP" not found, look for any LARGE volume number (>3000) that's NOT UF related
- **Typical range**: 3000-10000 mL or 3-10 L (usually larger than UF volumes)
- **SCAN STRATEGY**: Check every numerical display on screen, especially large volume numbers

FOR B. FLOW:
- Look for blood flow section
- May be labeled as "B.FLOW", "BLOOD FLOW", "QB", or "BF"
- Usually displayed prominently as it's a critical parameter
- Typical range: 200-500 mL/min

FOR B CONDUCT:
- Look for conductivity section alongside T CONDUCT
- May be labeled as "B CONDUCT", "B.CONDUCT", "BIC CONDUCT", or "BC"
- Usually displayed near other conductivity readings
- Typical range: 2-5 mS/cm (lower than T CONDUCT)

**BOTTOM DISPLAY SEARCH - ENHANCED TARGETING:**

The BOTTOM section may contain additional parameter displays:

**BOTTOM_DISPLAY_1 & BOTTOM_DISPLAY_2:**
- **Location**: Bottom area of the display screen
- **Visual**: May be LED-style displays, digital readouts, or status indicators
- **Format**: Could be numbers, text, or alphanumeric codes
- **Search strategy**: Scan entire bottom width for ANY visible displays
- **Examples**: "280", "0.18", "READY", "AUTO", status codes
- **Extract all**: Include ALL visible bottom displays even without clear labels
